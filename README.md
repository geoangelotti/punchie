A project that handles ye old Punched cards based on http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards/codes.html.

Using Python2 you can transform strings to Punched cards (keypunches).

_I suggest you use a [Virtual Environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)._

1. Set up the Python2 Virtual Environment.  
`virtualenv -p python2 venv`
2. Activate it.     
`source venv/bin/activate`  
3. Run the example script.  
`python example.py`
4. Deactivate the Virtual Environment when you finish it.    
`deactivate`
